# Releases and Branching.

* Developer branches should follow the scheme <branch name>.<github user id>
* Releases are based on version tags.
   * Each public release will be tagged. Tags for releases are the version number Ex: 0.1.0, 0.1.tp
      * The versions consist of \<major number\>.\<minor number\>.\<patch\>
   * Tags are used to set the version information in the packages.
* Hot fixes for a release will be developed and tested on a branch created off the tag for the release.
